# Knowledge Base

This Knowledge Base is an 'it works on my machine' project where I document all the little details the brain might not remember later.

I am using Arch Linux. But all the information shown should work on your machine too! I focus a lot on the independence and universality of my workflow and because of that most of the programs I use are cross platform, versatile and neat.

Don't run code snippets you don't understand on a computer, I accept no liability for any damages arising from your use of provided information on this website.

Good luck internet traveller :)
